The user opened a details dialog. Modules should do whatever initialisation
they need and call userinfo/addpage one or more times if they want pages
displayed in the options dialog
wParam = addInfo
lParam = (LPARAM)hContact
addInfo should be passed straight to the wParam of userinfo/addpage
NB: The built-in userinfo module is loaded after all plugins, so calling
HookEvent() in your plugin's Load(void) function will fail if you specify this
hook. Look up core/m_system.h:me_system_modulesloaded.
